 # Seasonal_shopping_trends
 This dataset encompasses various features related to customer shopping preferences, gathering essential information for businesses
seeking to enhance their understanding of their customer base. The features include customer age, gender, purchase amount, preferred payment methods,
frequency of purchases, and feedback ratings. Additionally, data on the type of items purchased, shopping frequency, preferred shopping seasons,
and interactions with promotional offers is included. With a collection of 3900 records,
this dataset serves as a foundation for businesses looking to apply data-driven insights for better decision-making and customer-centric strategies.
- Additional features on the project are the exploration of performing initial eda steps using tableau, circling back to verify  the data in python visuals and EDA.
- readme will contain tableau visual, followed by the python equivalent for Eda performed on DF.

# Acknowledgement
This dataset is a synthetic creation generated using ChatGPT to simulate a realistic customer shopping experience.
Its purpose is to provide a platform for beginners and data enthusiasts, allowing them to create, enjoy, practice, 
and learn from a dataset that mirrors real-world customer shopping behavior. The aim is to foster learning and experimentation in a simulated environment,
encouraging a deeper understanding of data analysis and interpretation in the context of consumer preferences and retail scenarios.
